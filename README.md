## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox and place the items in the middle of the screen. I learned how to set the max-width for the cards so they don't become too wide on bigger screen sizes.

I learned to add hover effects for the buttons and a nice transition for the effect.

I really enjoyed building this project. It was my first one on Frontend Mentor and I was first little bit scared to start it and build something on my own. But in the end all went well and I'm excited to start a new project.

### Continued development

I want to develop my skills with flexbox with more complicated flexbox projects.
